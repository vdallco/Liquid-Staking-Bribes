# Liquid-Staking-Bribes
ERC-20 token bribes for LSD Network Owners and Node Runners of Blockswap's Stakehouse liquid-staking derivatives platform.

# How does it work
Node Runners may deposit ERC-20 tokens into the Bribe Vault to incentivize stakers to fund the Node Runner's validators via Fren Delegation.

LSD Network owners may deposit ERC-20 tokens into the Bribe Vault to incentivize Node Runners to join their network.

The Bribe Vault contracts use various Stakehouse contracts to determine which wallets may claim, how much, etc.
